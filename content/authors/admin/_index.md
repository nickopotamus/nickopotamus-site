You’ve stumbled upon my personal website, which hosts predominantly work related ramblings and the occasional poorly written piece of amateurish open source code or bad statistical interpretation.

I’m an anaesthetics and intensive care specialty trainee in the East Midlands, with interests in:
* Neuroanaesthesia and intensive care
* Training and improving standards in [retrieval and transfer medicine](/tag/transfer/)
* Motorsport medicine
* Various research themes including [critical care delirium](/tag/delirium/), [decision making](/tag/cdecision-making) in intensive care, and risk prediction using machine learning
* Making [data science in the healthcare space](/tag/data-science/) understandable and accessible
* Applying research methodologies to quality improvement in healthcare
