abstract: As a group of anaesthetic trainees based in the United Kingdom, we read
  with interest your recent practice article discussing procedural sedation [1]. It
  is always refreshing to contrast practices from different regions, and even more
  so different continents. However, we feel that we should highlight a few small,
  but serious, omissions that raise patient safety concerns.
