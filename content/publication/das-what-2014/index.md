abstract: We present a rare case of large bowel obstruction secondary to colonic gallstones
  in a frail nonagenarian. Uniquely, the stone was impacted in the descending colon-sigmoid
  junction, in the absence of underlying bowel pathology distal to the stone. In light
  of worsening pain and distension after failed endoscopic treatment, the patient
  was treated with an emergency laparotomy. After an on-table dilemma, a proximal
  defunctioning loop colostomy was fashioned and the stone left in situ, with the
  eventual fate of the stone currently undecided. We also discuss alternative treatment
  options and explain the thought processes that lead to our decision.
