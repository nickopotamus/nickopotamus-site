 abstract = {We present a rare case of large bowel obstruction secondary to colonic gallstones in a frail nonagenarian. Uniquely, the stone was impacted in the descending colon-sigmoid junction, in the absence of underlying bowel pathology distal to the stone. In light of worsening pain and distension after failed endoscopic treatment, the patient was treated with an emergency laparotomy. After an on-table dilemma, a proximal defunctioning loop colostomy was fashioned and the stone left in situ, with the eventual fate of the stone currently undecided. We also discuss alternative treatment options and explain the thought processes that lead to our decision.},
