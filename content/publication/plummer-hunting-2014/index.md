abstract: The seemingly straightforward diagnosis of acute ischaemic stroke can be
  complicated by the presence of conditions presenting similarly to stroke, and atypical
  strokes presenting with confusing and non-classical signs. We present a diagnostic
  quest to disentangle the effects of a number of stroke mimics from those of an underlying
  bilateral cerebrovascular phenomena, where with appropriate treatment of the non-stroke
  conditions the patient was able to make a near complete neurological recovery.
