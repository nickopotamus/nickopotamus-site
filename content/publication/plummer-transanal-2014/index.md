abstract: Perforation into the gastrointestinal tract is a rare complication of ventriculoperitoneal
  shunt insertion. We present a case of transanal protrusion of the shunt catheter
  in an otherwise asymptomatic patient, with only transient signs of shunt failure
  some 2 months prior to presentation, and discuss treatment options to rationalise
  our decision to treat with laparotomy and preservation of the shunt.
