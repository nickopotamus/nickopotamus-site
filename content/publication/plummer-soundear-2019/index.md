abstract: 'Introduction: Elevated sound levels in critical care are associated with
  sleep deprivation and an increased incidence of delirium. We aimed to determine
  whether a sound-activated visual noise display meter could cause a sustained reduction
  in sound levels overnight in an adult critical care unit. Method: Sound levels were
  recorded overnight for eight days before and after the introduction of a visual
  noise display meter, with a further eight days recorded four months later after
  continued use of the visual noise display meter. Results: Median ambient sound levels
  were significantly reduced from 57.4 dB by 3.9 dB, with a sustained reduction of
  3.6 dB from baseline after four months of the device operating. Peak ambient sound
  levels had a small but significant reduction from 66.0 dB by 0.7 dB, with a sustained
  reduction of 0.8 dB after four months. Discussion: Sound-activated visual noise
  display meters can be effective in providing a sustained reduction in ambient sound
  overnight in adult critical care units, which would appear to be driven by behavioural
  change.'
