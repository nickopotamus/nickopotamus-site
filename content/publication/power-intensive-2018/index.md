abstract: "Introduction: Decision-making regarding admission to UK intensive care\
  \ units is challenging. Demand for beds exceeds capacity, yet the need to provide\
  \ emergency cover creates pressure to build redundancy into the system. Guidelines\
  \ to aid clinical decision-making are outdated, resulting in an over-reliance on\
  \ professional judgement. Although clinicians are highly skilled, there is variability\
  \ in intensive care unit decision-making, especially at the inter-specialty level\
  \ wherein cognitive biases contribute to disagreement. Method: This research is\
  \ the first to explore intensive care unit referral and admission decision-making\
  \ using the Critical Decision Method interviewing technique. We interviewed intensive\
  \ care unit (n = 9) and non-intensive care unit (n = 6) consultants about a challenging\
  \ referral they had dealt with in the past where there was disagreement about the\
  \ patient's suitability for intensive care unit. Results: We present: (i) a description\
  \ of the referral pathway; (ii) challenges that appear to derail referrals (i.e.\
  \ process issues, decision biases, inherent stressors, post-decision consequences)\
  \ and (iii) potential solutions to improve this process. Discussion: This research\
  \ provides a foundation upon which interventions to improve inter-specialty decision-making\
  \ can be based."
