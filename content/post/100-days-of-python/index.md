I'm a firm believer that [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) is the One True Language for statistical programming, but I can't deny that [Python](https://www.python.org/) is a very popular language among data scientists, especially those involved in machine learning (ML). It's also a fairly good introduction to programming for non-coders, with a [readable and straightforward syntax](https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython/02-basic-python-syntax.html), an easy transition into [object-orientated programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), and is [almost as good as ggplot2 for data visualisation](https://towardsdatascience.com/matplotlib-vs-ggplot2-which-to-choose-for-2020-and-beyond-ced5e294bfdc). It's also a core part of my Masters course, so probably worth me putting some effort into (re-)learning.

Luckily for those wannabe Pythonistas, the brilliant [London App Brewery](https://www.londonappbrewery.com/) have recently released a [100 Days of Python bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). It can be picked up for a very reasonable Â£13.99 at the moment using code ```NEWLEARNINGS``` ([3.5 pints](https://www.morningadvertiser.co.uk/Article/2020/08/07/What-is-the-average-price-of-a-pint) at the Christmas Party you won't be having this year) which I really don't begrudge Angela Yu based on the quality of her [Flutter bootcamp given away for free during Lockdown1](https://www.appbrewery.co/p/intro-to-flutter), but if you really don't want to part with a few quid it can - as with most Udemy courses - be found online for "free" with a bit of Googling.

A few healthcare workers, including me, are going to be working through the bootcamp over the coming 100(ish) days, so if you want to join us get in touch [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/medicspythonchallenge) and we'll muddle through together. I'll be posting [my solutions on GitHub](https://github.com/nickopotamus/100-days-of-python) and [Repl](https://repl.it/@nickopotamus/) as we go along.

Good luck!
